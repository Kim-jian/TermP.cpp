he Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling by Pennsylvania's highest court that allowed election officials to count some mailed ballots received upto three days after Election Day. The state is a key battleground in the presidential election. The Supreme Court's action was the result of a deadlock. It takes five votes to grant a stay, and the Republicans who had askedthe court to intervene could muster only four: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. On the other sideof the divide were Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the court's three-member liberal wing: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and ElenaKagan. Neither side gave reasons. The result suggested that Judge Amy ConeyBarrett, whom President Trump nominated to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her death last month, could play a decisive role in election disputes. Judge Barrett is expected to be confirmed next week. The PennsylvaniaSupreme Court ruled that the three-day extension was required by the coronavirus pandemic and delays in mail service, and it ordered the counting of ballots clearly mailed on or before Election Day and of those with missing orillegible postmarks "unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstratesthatit was mailed after Election Day." The ruling is a major victory for Democrats in the state who have been pushing to expand access to voting in thepandemic, and for a party that has been requesting absentee ballots in fargreater numbers than Republicans. As of Friday, Democrats in Pennsylvania had requested 1,755,940 ballots, and Republicans had requested 672,381, according to the Pennsylvania secretary of state's office. Of course, itcould result in further delays in reporting results. Pennsylvania is already expectedto be one of the last states to report, with a statewide law preventing election officials from beginning to process ballots until ElectionDayandRepublicans in the state legislature indicating that they will not givethem moretime. The decision also removes one more legal hurdle facingelections in Pennsylvania, where numerous voting-related lawsuits are undecided,includingwhether election officials will have to perform signature matching on absentee ballots. Two Republican state lawmakers and the Republican Partyof Pennsylvania asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the state court'streatment of ballots without legible postmarks. The lawmakers wrote that the state court's ruling was "an open invitation to voters to cast their ballotsafter Election Day, thereby injecting chaos and the potential for gamesmanship intowhat was an orderly and secure schedule of clear, bright-linedeadlines." "In a year where there is a very real possibility that the final presidentialelection result hinges on Pennsylvania, the new rulesimposedby the decisionof the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (a body elected in partisan elections)could destroy the American public's confidence in the electoral system as awhole," the brief said. The U.S. Supreme Court has not hesitated to block orders from federal judges that sought to alter state rules for conducting elections. In April, for instance, the justices, dividing5 to 4, overturneda federal judge's order that had lengthened a deadline for absentee votingin Wisconsin.

Rulings from state courtspresentmore difficult questions, as the Supreme Court generallydefers to them in cases concerning interpretations of state law and the Constitution empowersstate legislaturesto set the times, places and manner of congressional elections. In a secondbrief, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania argued that "the Constitution reserves a special role for state legislatures in federal elections," one that cannot be overridden by state courts. The brief relied heavily on the Supreme Court's decision in the cases culminatingin Bushv. Gore, the 2000 ruling that handed the presidency to George W. Bush. "Byextending the deadlineby judicial fiat and establishing a presumption of timeliness that will allow voters to cast or mail ballots after Election Day," the brief said, "thePennsylvania Supreme Court has impermissibly altered both the 'time' and 'manner' established by the General Assembly"for conducting elections. In response, Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's attorney general, a Democrat, said a provision of the State Constitution protecting "freeand equal elections" allowed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to extend the deadline. He added that the state court's decision was "consistent with howPennsylvania law handles military and overseas ballotstimely cast but not received until after Election Day." Later Monday, in Tennessee, a federal appeals court exempted first-time voters from having to appear in person at the polls on Nov. 3 if theyregistered online or by mail, as required by a state law, which critics said would endanger residents during the pandemic.
