The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling by Pennsylvania's highest court that allowed election officials to count some mailed ballots received up to three days after Election Day. The state is a key battleground in thepresidential election. The Supreme Court's action was the result of a deadlock. It takes five votes to grant a stay, and the Republicans who had askedthe court to intervene could muster only four: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. On the other sideof the divide were Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the court's three-member liberal wing: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and ElenaKagan. Neither side gave reasons. The result suggested that Judge Amy ConeyBarrett, whom President Trump nominated to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her death last month, could play a decisive role in election disputes. Judge Barrett is expected to be confirmed next week. The PennsylvaniaSupreme Court ruled that the three-day extension was required by the coronavirus pandemic and delays in mail service, and it ordered the countingof ballots clearly mailed on or before Election Day and of those with missing orillegible postmarks "unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day." The ruling is a major victory for Democrats in the state who have been pushing to expand access to votingin thepandemic, and for a party that has been requesting absentee ballotsin far greater numbers than Republicans. As of Friday, Democrats in Pennsylvania hadrequested 1,755,940 ballots, and Republicans had requested 672,381, according to the Pennsylvania secretary of state's office.

Pennsylvania is alreadyexpectedto be one of the last states to report, with a statewide law preventingelection officials from beginning to process ballots until ElectionDayandRepublicans in the state legislature indicating that they will notgivethemmoretime. The decision also removes one more legal hurdle facingelectionsin Pennsylvania, where numerous voting-related lawsuits are undecided, includingwhether election officials will have to perform signature matching onabsenteeballots. Two Republican state lawmakers and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the state court's treatmentof ballots without legible postmarks. The lawmakers wrotethat the state court'sruling was "an open invitation to voters to cast their ballots after Election Day, thereby injecting chaos and the potential for gamesmanshipinto whatwas an orderly and secure schedule of clear, bright-line deadlines.""In ayear where there is a very real possibility that the final presidential election result hinges on Pennsylvania, the new rulesimposed by the decision ofthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (a body elected in partisan elections)could destroy the American public's confidence inthe electoralsystemas a whole," the brief said. The U.S. Supreme Court has not hesitated to block ordersfrom federal judges that sought to alter state rules forconductingelections.
