You're the only power (power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (power)
You're the only power that can
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning, babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning, babe
Nothing unwanted
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, na-na-na
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, na-na-na
If I ever instigated, I'm sorry
Tell me, who in here can relate? I, I, I
Now if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'mma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She get under your skin if you let her
She get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to say nothing
Everybody gon' say something
I'd be worried if they said nothing
Remind me where I know you from?
She looking like she owe you some'
You know just what we want
I want to wake up with you in my
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning, babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning, babe
Nothing unwanted

Ohhhhhhh

Ohhhhhhh
I go, I go, ay ay, I go
Up in the morning, miss you bad
Sorry I ain't called you back
The same problem my father had
All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good
Momma pass in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
I'll be taking all the stacks
I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga, pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
Taking all the stacks, oh
Stacks, oh
Taking all the stacks, oh
I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and sipping Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Wake up Versace, shit life Desiigner
Whole bunch of lavish shit
They be asking round town who be clappin shit
I pullin up stuff in the Phantom ship
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, killing on camera
How can I find you?
Who do you turn to?
How do I bind you?
If I don't turn to you
No other help I know, I stretch my hands
